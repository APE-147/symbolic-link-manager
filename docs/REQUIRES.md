## Latest Requirements - 2025-10-13

### Core Functionality
1. Detect all symbolic links in the directory: /Users/username/Developer/Cloud/Dropbox/-Code-
2. Classify symbolic links by their containing project
3. Display the current name of each symbolic link

### Classification System
- Support project classification via a user-defined markdown file
- Categories:
  - Classified items: display at top (priority)
  - Unclassified items: display at bottom

### Global CLI Tool
- Make the project globally callable using the command: `link`
- Interactive CLI features:
  - Navigate and select each symbolic link
  - Press Enter on a selected link to:
    - Show the current target path (actual location it points to)
    - Allow changing the target path to a new location

### Technical Requirements
- Implement as a complete, production-ready CLI tool
- Use appropriate error handling and validation
- Provide clear user feedback
- Support cross-platform compatibility where possible
- Include proper documentation

### Application Scenario
User needs to maintain symbolic links across a large codebase directory structure (/Users/username/Developer/Cloud/Dropbox/-Code-/). The tool should provide an intuitive way to:
- Discover all symbolic links
- Organize them by project context
- Interactively inspect and modify their targets
- Ensure consistency and prevent broken links
